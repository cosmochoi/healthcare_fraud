### This repo contains files for the capstone project at the NYCDSA bootcamp. In this project we analyzed health insurance data obtained from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/rohitrox/healthcare-provider-fraud-detection-analysis) and created machine learning models trained on these data to predict fraudulent providers.
